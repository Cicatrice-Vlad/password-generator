# password-generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The inspiration for this project was to supply the demand of an user that is looking to create new random passwords
- The password-generator was made in order for the user to generate a random password with every click of the button.
- The project helps the user to decide on a random password that has high security levels and makes it harder to be breached.
- The project made me realise that it is not so easy to use JavaScript but it is rewarding once something or everything works as intended.



## Usage

Simply access the URL below and continue answering to the engine's questions accordingly and as desired until a bespoke random password can be selected.
